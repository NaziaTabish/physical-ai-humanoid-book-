# Prompt Text

```text
/sp.constitution

Project Name:
Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – Essentials

Purpose:
Create a short, clean, professional, AI-native textbook based on the subject of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, delivered through a modern Docusaurus interface and deployed on GitHub Pages. The textbook must serve as a fast, simple, and high-quality learning resource for beginners and intermediate learners. The writing workflow must use Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code for structure, generation, and validation.

Core Objective:
Produce a concise, technically accurate, and visually clean textbook that explains the essentials of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics using a free-tier, low-resource, and lightweight approach.

Scope:
The textbook will contain exactly 6 short, focused chapters:

1. Introduction to Physical AI
   - Definition and scope of Physical AI
   - Difference between virtual AI and embodied AI
   - Real-world applications

2. Foundations of Robotics: Systems, Structure & Core Mechanisms
   - Robot components (sensors, actuators, controllers)
   - Mechanical structures
   - Basic control logic

3. Human-Inspired Design Principles in Humanoid Robotics
   - Biomimicry in robotics
   - Anthropomorphic structure
   - Ergonomics and balance concepts

4. Perception Systems in Humanoids
   - Vision systems
   - Sensor fusion
   - Environmental awareness

5. AI, Deep Learning & Control Systems
   - Role of AI in robotics
   - Basic machine learning concepts
   - Decision-making and control loops

6. Humanoid Locomotion and Manipulation
   - Walking principles
   - Arm and hand movement
   - Stability and balance basics

Out of Scope:
- No chatbot system
- No RAG integration
- No external question-answering features
- No advanced simulations
- No heavy datasets
- No GPU-dependent processes

Core Principles:
- Simplicity
- Accuracy
- Minimalism
- Fast builds
- Free-tier architecture
- Clean and readable writing
- Logical structure
- Beginner-friendly explanations

Technical Requirements:
- Built using Docusaurus
- Deployed on GitHub Pages
- Written using Spec-Kit Plus structure
- Content generated and refined through Claude Code
- Lightweight assets only (SVG, small PNG)
- No heavy libraries or backend services
- Static-site only

Content Guidelines:
- Clear and concise explanations
- Short paragraphs
- Bullet points for key ideas
- Diagrams in SVG when needed
- Minimal jargon or explained terminology
- Consistent formatting across chapters

UI & Design Principles:
- Clean, modern Docusaurus default theme
- High contrast and readability
- Simple navigation bar
- Chapter-based sidebar
- No clutter or visual overload

Writing Style:
- Professional
- Technical but accessible
- Minimal fluff
- High-density, high-value content
- Structured in headings and subheadings

Research Approach:
- Research-concurrent writing (no full research phase required upfront)
- Information verified while writing
- Focus on widely accepted robotics and AI fundamentals

Validation & Quality Checks:
- Each chapter must meet:
  - Relevance to topic
  - Technical accuracy
  - Clear explanation
  - Concise length
- Terminology consistency check
- Final proofreading pass

Build & Deployment Requirements:
- Successful local build in Docusaurus
- Successful GitHub Pages deployment
- No broken links
- No missing assets
- Fast load time
- Mobile and desktop compatibility

Success Criteria:
- Clean Docusaurus-based textbook
- Exactly 6 complete chapters
- Simple, readable UI
- Successful GitHub Pages deployment
- No external runtime dependencies
- Free-tier friendly
- Fast load speed

Phase Organization:
1. Research → Topic validation and structure alignment
2. Foundation → Setup Docusaurus + file structure
3. Analysis → Content refinement + consistency
4. Synthesis → Final edits + deployment

Decisions Requiring Documentation:
- Docusaurus theme selection
- Folder structure design
- Markdown formatting standards
- Image/diagram style
- Naming conventions

Testing Strategy:
- Run `npm start` for local preview
- Run `npm run build` for production test
- Validate sidebar & navigation
- Test on mobile & desktop view

Final Output:
A minimal, accurate, and production-ready AI-native textbook titled:
"Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – Essentials"
Hosted on GitHub Pages and structured as a clean, professional learning resource.
```

# Response Text

Created the project constitution for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. The constitution establishes core principles including simplicity and minimalism, technical accuracy and clarity, lightweight architecture, content-first development, standards compliance and accessibility, and research-concurrent writing. The document also defines technical requirements, development workflow, and governance rules for the project. The constitution is versioned as 1.0.0 and includes a sync impact report at the top of the file.

# Outcome

The project constitution has been successfully created and saved to `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. This document will serve as the governing framework for all development of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project, ensuring consistency with the core principles of simplicity, accuracy, and lightweight architecture.
