# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – Essentials Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity and Minimalism
All implementations must prioritize simplicity and minimalism; Code, content, and design must follow "less is more" philosophy; Complexity must be justified with clear benefits outweighing maintenance overhead.

### II. Technical Accuracy and Clarity
All content must maintain high technical accuracy and clarity; Explanations must be accessible to beginners while remaining technically sound; All concepts must be clearly defined with minimal jargon or proper terminology explanations.

### III. Lightweight Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
The textbook must use lightweight architecture only; Docusaurus with default theme, static-site generation, no heavy libraries or backend services; Free-tier hosting compatible with fast builds and load times.

### IV. Content-First Development
Development must prioritize content quality and structure; All technical decisions must support optimal content delivery and readability; User experience must be secondary to content accuracy and clarity.

### V. Standards Compliance and Accessibility
All implementations must follow web standards and accessibility guidelines; High contrast and readability required; Mobile and desktop compatibility essential for learning accessibility.

### VI. Research-Concurrent Writing

Content development must occur alongside research and verification; Information must be validated while writing; Focus on widely accepted robotics and AI fundamentals rather than speculative future technologies.

## Technical Requirements
<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Security Requirements, Performance Standards, etc. -->

All implementations must use Docusaurus framework with GitHub Pages deployment; Content must be written in Markdown with consistent formatting standards; Only lightweight assets (SVG, small PNG) allowed; No external runtime dependencies permitted.
<!-- Example: Technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc. -->

## Development Workflow
<!-- Example: Development Workflow, Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

All content must undergo validation for relevance, technical accuracy, clear explanation, and concise length; Each chapter must meet defined acceptance criteria before completion; Writing workflow must use Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code for structure, generation, and validation.
<!-- Example: Code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc. -->

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

This constitution governs all development of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook; All changes must comply with core principles; Amendments require explicit documentation and team approval; All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with simplicity, accuracy, and lightweight architecture requirements.
<!-- Example: All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for runtime development guidance -->
